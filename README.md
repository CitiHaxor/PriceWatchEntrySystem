Welcome to the CitiHaxor Price Watch Entry System Prototype! For PolyHack.

This project is built on ASP.Net and is currently not deployed on any server.
.NET Framework 4.7.2

Instructions:
Install Microsoft Visual Studio, install the ASP.net packages, download this repo and launch the solution. To launch the local host website, enable debugging on IIS Express.

When you first launch the website, you need to create a new user account to login to the system. Click create a new user account at the homepage and select whatever supermarket and role you want. It is solely developed as a prototype only for demo purposes.

There is a example input file called ExampleDataFile.csv that is used to input data into our price watch system in the "Data Entry" function, which can be accessed from the Navigation Bar.
